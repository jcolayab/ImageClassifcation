# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

# To run the program type:
# training the nn: 
#     python train.py 
#     sh run_train.sh
# Predicting:
#     python predict.py
#     sh run_predcit.sh

# References for this project
#    The training and testing for the neural network was taken from the Audacity classes.
